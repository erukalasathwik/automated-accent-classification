# Automated English Accent Classification with Deep Learning

This project implements a real-time English accent classification system using deep learning. The application records a 3-second audio sample and predicts the accent—such as Indian, American, or British—with confidence scores.

## Demo
Record your voice for 3 seconds and see the model classify your accent with percentage-based confidence.

## Features
- Real-time microphone recording
- Predicts accent as Indian, American, or British
- Shows confidence levels
- No internet or dataset required
- Simple UI with Streamlit

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Librosa
- SoundDevice
- Streamlit
-matplotlib

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-accent-classification.git
   cd automated-accent-classification

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app(streamlit):
   streamlit run app.py

4. When prompted,speak for 3seconds.the system will output predicted accent and percentage
